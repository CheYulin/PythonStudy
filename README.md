# Python Study
##Python2.7 Study
- [Python2.7 Study](study), which is split into two parts, namely 1) language core and libraries, 2) third party libraries

- language core

[data structure](study/language_core_and_lib/data_structure) | algorithm, structure, collection, string 
[function](study/language_core_and_lib/function) | function, operator 
[os](study/language_core_and_lib/os) | rename, system 
[regex](study/language_core_and_lib/regex) | regex 


- third-party libraries

[plot](study/third_party_library/plot) | matplot

##Crypto Study
- [Course Materials](course_materials), which covers following contents.
  - three assignments
  - one report about identity-based encryption system, which is one type of public-key cipher.

- [Cryptography Tool](crpyto_tool), which covers following contents.
